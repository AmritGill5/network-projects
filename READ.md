## Projects

### 1. Packet Tracer LAN Simulation
- Designed a basic LAN network in Cisco Packet Tracer with 2 PCs and a switch.  
- Configured IPv4 addresses and verified connectivity using the `ping` command.  
- **Skills:** Networking basics, IP addressing, subnetting, Cisco Packet Tracer.  
- **File:** `Project1_PacketTracer/SimpleLAN.pkt`

**Interview Talking Point:**  
This project demonstrates my understanding of how devices in a network communicate using IP addresses and how to validate connectivity with simple tools like ping.

### 2. Python Port Scanner
- Built a Python script to scan for open ports on a target machine using sockets.  
- Demonstrates cybersecurity reconnaissance and ethical hacking fundamentals.  
- **Skills:** Python, sockets, port scanning, network security basics.  
- **File:** `Project2_PortScanner/port_scanner.py`

**Interview Talking Point:**  
This project shows my ability to code basic cybersecurity tools and my understanding of why scanning for open ports is important for securing networks.

### 3. Router Automation with Python
- Automated router configuration using the Netmiko Python library.  
- Reduces repetitive manual tasks for network engineers.  
- **Skills:** Python automation, SSH, network device configuration.  
- **File:** `Project3_Automation/router_config.py`

**Interview Talking Point:**  
This project highlights my knowledge of network automation and how Python can make network management faster and more reliable.

### 4. Machine Learning Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
- Trained a Random Forest Classifier on sample network traffic data.  
- Detects whether incoming traffic is normal or malicious.  
- **Skills:** Python (pandas, scikit-learn), machine learning, cybersecurity.  
- **File:** `Project4_ML_IDS/ml_ids.py`

**Interview Talking Point:**  
This project connects AI with cybersecurity by showing how machine learning can help detect intrusions in real-time, an area that is highly relevant to the future of network security.
